# A-type runtime
A-type is a C-based object system designed for efficient reflection and robust interface clarity, balancing the flexibility of dynamic languages with the precision of systems programming. Use familiar OOP patterns in C with less boilerplate. Reflective API and meta types allow for sophisticated controls in compact code.  The result of that is scalable performance.  It's javascript meeting C and python in self expanding fashion.
