# A-type runtime
A-type C library brings modern object-oriented capabilities to systems programming, offering classes, reflection, and smart memory management while maintaining predictable performance and ABI compatibility. It implements a low-overhead type system that emits reflective information directly into global initializers, minimizing runtime type costs while still providing rich introspection capabilities for public interfaces. The library includes production-ready implementations of essential data structures (arrays, hashmaps, strings) alongside a practical approach to encapsulation that cleanly separates public and private interfaces. All of this is achieved with careful attention to memory layout and initialization order, making it suitable for everything from embedded systems to high-performance servers where predictable behavior and efficient resource usage are critical.
